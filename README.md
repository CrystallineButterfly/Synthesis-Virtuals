# Commerce Identity Fabric

        **Repo:** `Synthesis-Virtuals`  
        **Primary track:** Virtuals  
        **Submission hold:** wait for human approval before registration or live submission.

        An identity fabric that maps agent personas, permissions, and payment surfaces into one reusable commerce and delegation layer.

        ## Selected concept

        An identity fabric maps agent personas, permissions, and payment surfaces into one reusable layer. The contract records identity state and trust anchors, while Python orchestration ties those identities to commerce and delegation flows.

        ## Idea set

        1. ERC-8183 Agent Identity Layer
2. ENS-Native Agent Commerce
3. ZK-Protected Persona Wallets

        ## Prize overlap targets

        - ENS
- Slice
- SelfProtocol
- ERC-8004 Receipts
- PayWithLocus
- SuperRare

        ## Tech stack

        Solidity 0.8.24 skeleton, Python 3.13 standard library, JSON manifests, Foundry-style layout, MIT license

        ## Security guardrails

        - principal and spend policies are separated by design
        - whitelist, cap, and cooldown checks gate every action
        - dry-run hashes are recorded before any live execution path
        - compute budgets are explicit and live mode is opt-in
        - secrets are loaded from environment variables only
        - structured logs are appended for every discover-plan-execute-verify step

        ## Autonomy loop

        1. Discover candidate signals and external state.
2. Plan an action bundle with explicit budget, target, and purpose.
3. Run a dry-run check and policy validation before any execution path.
4. Execute only when live mode, wallets, and credentials are supplied.
5. Verify receipts, proofs, and notes, then append structured logs.

        ## Local MVP status

        - [x] README, manifests, and security notes created
        - [x] contract and agent-loop skeletons created
        - [x] local git repository initialized with an initial commit
        - [ ] operator wallet addresses attached
        - [ ] real API keys added through `.env`
        - [ ] live TxIDs recorded
        - [ ] registration and submission executed

        ## Live demo and TxID plan

        1. load real credentials into `.env`
        2. run `python3 scripts/plan_live_demo.py` to print the checklist
        3. replace placeholder wallet fields in `agent.json`
        4. enable `LIVE_MODE=true` for controlled execution
        5. record resulting TxIDs and paste them into `submissions/synthesis.md`

        ## Why this ranks first

        This concept ranks highest because it overlaps ENS, Slice, SelfProtocol while keeping the
        execution envelope explicit, dry-run-first, and honest about what still needs
        real credentials before anything touches a chain.
